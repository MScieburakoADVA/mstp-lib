	<h4>
		Summary</h4>
	<p>
		Function which the application must call approximately once every second.</p>
	<h4>
		Parameters</h4>
	<dl>
		<dt>bridge</dt>
		<dd>Pointer to a STP_BRIDGE object, obtained from <a href="STP_CreateBridge.html">
			STP_CreateBridge</a>.</dd>
		<dt>timestamp</dt>
		<dd>A timestamp used for the debug log. </dd>
	</dl>
	<h4>
		Remarks</h4>
		<p>
			If the application runs multiple bridges, is it recommended that a single periodic timer 
			is set up, and that this function is called for each bridge when this timer triggers, with the same 
			value for <code>timestamp</code> 
			for all bridges. This makes it easier to 
			visualize in the debug log which tick triggered which actions on which 
			bridge.</p>
	
	<p>
			Execution of this function is a potentially lengthy process. 
			It may call various callbacks multiple times.</p>
	<p>
		It is allowed to call this function for stopped bridges. In this case it will return 
		immediately.</p>
	<p>
		If many devices are wired in the same STP network, it is recommended that the timer 
		period is not identical on all devices, but spread a little around the one-second value 
		(for instance, between 950 and 1050 ms). This helps avoid bursts of STP activity occurring 
		on all devices at the same time. Note that there&#39;s still a chance these bursts are 
		once in a while synchronized accross the network, so the whole system must still be 
		designed to handle them.</p>
	<p>
		This function may not be called from within an <a href="STP_CALLBACKS.html">STP callback</a>.</p>
