	<h4>
		Summary</h4>
	<p>
		Function which the application must call upon receiving a BPDU packet from a physical 
		port.</p>
	<h4>
		Parameters</h4>
	<dl>
		<dt>bridge</dt>
		<dd>Pointer to an STP_BRIDGE object, obtained from <a href="STP_CreateBridge.html">
			STP_CreateBridge</a>.</dd>
		<dt>portIndex</dt>
		<dd>The index of the port from which this BPDU was received. This information is usually 
			inserted by the switch IC into the Ethernet frame, after the switch IC was 
			configured to do so by <a href="StpCallback_EnableBpduTrapping.html">
			StpCallback_EnableBpduTrapping</a>.</dd>
		<dt>bpdu</dt>
		<dd>Pointer to the BPDU payload, located in an Ethernet frame just after the LLC field.</dd>
		<dt>bpduSize</dt>
		<dd>Size of the BPDU payload.</dd>
		<dt>timestamp</dt>
		<dd>A timestamp used for the debug log. </dd>
	</dl>
	<h4>
		Remarks</h4>
		<p>
			Execution of this function is a potentially lengthy process. 
			It may call various callbacks multiple times.</p>
		
	<p>
		It is allowed to call this function for stopped bridges. In this case it will ignore the BPDU and return immediately.</p>
	<p>
		This function validates the length of the BPDU before processing its content. It ignores 
		truncated BPDUs.</p>
	<p>
		It is recommended that the application, before passing a received BPDU frame to the STP 
		library, performs a check for malformed frames by comparing the value in the 
		EtherType/Size field of the frame to the length of the received frame. Such malformed 
		frames should be discarded, not passed to the STP library.</p>
		
	<p>
		It is recommended that the application, <em>after</em> receiving a BPDU from the bridge IC 
		and <em>before</em> passing the BPDU to this function, checks that it has up-to-date 
		information about the &quot;operational&quot; status of the physical port from which it received the 
		BPDU. Depending on the hardware particularities, it is possible that an application first
		<strong>1)</strong> receives an Ethernet packet from a physical port, and then <strong>2)</strong> 
		receives information from that port about the link having just been established (e.g., 
		cable just connected). If the application finds itself in this condition upon receiving a 
		BPDU, it should first call <a href="STP_OnPortEnabled.html">STP_OnPortEnabled</a>, and 
		only then STP_OnBpduReceived; the timestamp should be the same value for both calls.</p>
	<p>
		This function may not be called from within an <a href="STP_CALLBACKS.html">STP callback</a>.</p>
