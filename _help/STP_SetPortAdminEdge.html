	<h4>
		Summary</h4>
	<p>
		Sets the AdminEdge parameter for a given port.</p>
	<h4>
		Parameters</h4>
	<dl>
		<dt>bridge</dt>
		<dd>Pointer to a STP_BRIDGE object, obtained from <a href="STP_CreateBridge.html">
			STP_CreateBridge</a>.</dd>
		<dt>portIndex</dt>
		<dd>The index of the port for which the AdminEdge parameter is to be set.</dd>
		<dt>newAdminEdge</dt>
		<dd>The new value of the AdminEdge parameter.</dd>
	</dl>
	<h4>
		Remarks</h4>
		<p>
			See §13.25.1 in 802.1Q-2011 for more information.</p>
	<p>
			The current library code was not tested in scenarios where this function is called after the bridge 
			has been started. It was only tested in scenarios where this function is called once, after <a href="STP_CreateBridge.html">STP_CreateBridge</a> is 
			called, and before <a href="STP_StartBridge.html">STP_StartBridge</a> is called.</p>
	
	<p>
			Execution of this function is a potentially lengthy process. 
			It may call various callbacks multiple times.</p>
	<p>
			When a port is configured as Edge by calling this function with <code>adminEdge</code> true, the 
			library will still be sending BPDUs to that port, and will still need to receive and 
			process BPDUs from that port. This is not a characteristic of this particular library; it is a 
			characteristic of the STP protocol itself. This behavior is useful in case the end user 
			configures a port as Edge by mistake (e.g., correctly configures a port as Edge in one 
			location but later moves the switch to another location and doesn&#39;t remember to 
			reconfigure that port.)</p>
	<p>
			This function may not be called from within an <a href="STP_CALLBACKS.html">STP callback</a>.</p>
