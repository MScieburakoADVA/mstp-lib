	<h4>
		Summary</h4>
	<p>
		Function which the application must call when 
		the MAC_Operational parameter of a port (known otherwise as &quot;link good&quot; or &quot;link 
		up&quot; in switch IC specs) changes to TRUE. See the Remarks 
		section for more details.</p>
	<h4>
		Parameters</h4>
	<dl>
		<dt>bridge</dt>
		<dd>Pointer to an STP_BRIDGE object, obtained from <a href="STP_CreateBridge.html">
			STP_CreateBridge</a>.</dd>
		<dt>portIndex</dt>
		<dd>The index of the port whose MAC_Operational parameter has just changed to TRUE.</dd>
		<dt>speedMegabitsPerSecond</dt>
		<dd>The communication speed detected on the port (a value such as 100 for 100 Mbps). This 
			value is used by the STP library to compute path costs.</dd>
		<dt>detectedPointToPointMAC</dt>
		<dd>The application must pass <code>true</code> when the port hardware detects a point-to-point link, or 
			<code>false</code> otherwise. See the Remarks section for more information.</dd>
		<dt>timestamp</dt>
		<dd>A timestamp used for the debug log. </dd>
	</dl>
	<h4>
		Remarks</h4>
		<p>
			For detailed information about the MAC_Operational parameter, see §11.2 and §11.3 in 802.1AC-2016.</p>
	<p>
		The application can usually detect changes in the operational state of a port by polling 
		an internal register of the PHY of a physical port. Refer to the specifications of the 
		switch chip for details on how to do this.</p>
	<p>
		You should check the electrical schematic of your device and, if needed, establish in 
		the application code a mapping between <strong>1)</strong> the <code>portIndex</code> values 
		that your application uses to communicate with the STP library, and <strong>2)</strong> the port numbers that your 
		application uses to communicate with the switch IC. This mapping is not always a 
		1:1 mapping; it depends on the hardware particularities whether or not it is.</p>
	<p>
		The <code>detectedPointToPointMAC</code> parameter can usually be hardcoded by the application to <code>true</code> with all modern hardware, 
		because such hardware uses exclusively point-to-point links: RJ45 connections, RMII buses, 
		fiber optic cable etc. The application should pass <code>false</code> in case of non-point-to-point 
		links such as multi-drop coaxial cable. The STP library uses this parameter, together with 
		<code>adminPointToPointMAC</code>, to compute <code>operPointToPointMAC</code>. The current library code was tested 
		on real hardware only with 
		point-to-point links.</p>
	<p>
			Execution of this function is a potentially lengthy process. 
			It may call various callbacks multiple times.</p>
	<p>
			The application must not call this function for already enabled ports (i.e., must not call 
			it twice in a row). For convenience, the <a href="STP_GetPortEnabled.html">STP_GetPortEnabled</a> 
			is provided, which the application can use to check whether it had previously enabled or 
			disabled a port.</p>
	<p>
			This function must not be called from within an <a href="STP_CALLBACKS.html">STP callback</a>.</p>
