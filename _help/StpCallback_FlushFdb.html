(
    const STP_BRIDGE*        bridge,

	<h4>
		Summary</h4>
	<p>Application-defined function that flushes FDB entries (MAC-to-port associations)
		on a physical port.
		</p>
	<p>
		<code>StpCallback_FlushFdb</code> is a placeholder name used throughout this documentation. The
		application may name this callback differently.</p>
	<h4>
		Parameters</h4>
	<dl>
		<dt>bridge</dt>
		<dd>The application receives in this parameter a pointer to the bridge object returned by
			<a href="STP_CreateBridge.html">STP_CreateBridge</a>.</dd>
		<dt>portIndex</dt>
		<dd>The application receives in this parameter the index of the port on which FDB entries are to be flushed.</dd>
		<dt>treeIndex</dt>
		<dd>The application receives in this parameter the index of the spanning tree for which FDB
			entries are to be flushed. For STP or RSTP, this is always zero. For MSTP, this is zero
			for CIST, or 1..64 for a MSTI.</dd>
		<dt>flushType</dt>
		<dd>The application receives in this parameter a value representing the type of flushing it
			must perform. See the Remarks section for more information.</dd>
	</dl>
	<h4>Remarks</h4>
	<p>In complex networks, and especially in MSTP mode, the STP library can call
		this function dozens of times in a row, with various combinations of parameters.
		This is due to the protocol itself (i.e., it is not a characteristic of this
		particular library). For that reason, the implementation of this function
		should not take more than a few milliseconds. Usually all this function needs
		to do is write a few bytes to the internal registers of the switch IC.</p>
	<p>If <code>flushType</code> is <code>STP_FLUSH_FDB_TYPE_IMMEDIATE</code>, the application must flush the FDB entries
		and return after the flush is completed in hardware. This value is received for RSTP and
		MSTP bridges (i.e., when <code>STP_VERSION_RSTP</code> or <code>STP_VERSION_MSTP</code> was passed to
		<a href="STP_CreateBridge.html">STP_CreateBridge</a> or STP_SetStpVersion).</p>
	<p>If <code>flushType</code> is <code>STP_FLUSH_FDB_TYPE_RAPID_AGEING</code>, the application must initiate FDB
		flushing and return without waiting for flushing to be completed in hardware. This
		behavior is used in legacy STP (pre-RSTP) bridges (i.e., when <code>STP_VERSION_LEGACY_STP</code>
		was passed to <a href="STP_CreateBridge.html">STP_CreateBridge</a> or
		<a href="STP_SetStpVersion.html">STP_SetStpVersion</a>).</p>
