	<h4>
		Summary</h4>
	<p>
		Sets the settable priority component - most significant 4 bits - of the BridgeIdentifier 
		(§13.26.2 in 802.1Q-2018).</p>
	<h4>
		Parameters</h4>
	<dl>
		<dt>bridge</dt>
		<dd>Pointer to a STP_BRIDGE object, obtained from <a href="STP_CreateBridge.html">
			STP_CreateBridge</a>.</dd>
		<dt>treeIndex</dt>
		<dd>The index of the spanning tree for which bridge priority is to be set. For STP or RSTP, 
			this must be zero. For MSTP, this must be zero for the CIST, or 1..64 for an MSTI.</dd>
		<dt>bridgePriority</dt>
		<dd>A value specifiying the bridge priority. Must be between 0 and 61440 (0xF000 hex), in 
			steps of 4096 (0x1000 hex).</dd>
		<dt>timestamp</dt>
		<dd>A timestamp used for the debug log. </dd>
	</dl>
	<h4>
		Remarks</h4>
		<p>
			Default priority is 32768 (0x8000 hex). This default priority is assigned to a bridge when 
			it is created with <a href="STP_CreateBridge.html">STP_CreateBridge</a>.</p>
	<p>
		The BridgeIdentifier for a given spanning tree is usually represented as
		<span class="auto-style1">8</span><span class="auto-style4">000</span>.<span 
			class="auto-style3">01-02-03-04-05-06</span> and consists of:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><span class="auto-style1">4 bits set by this function</span>. These are the most 
			significant bits.</li>
		<li><span class="auto-style4">12 bits with the &quot;system ID extension&quot;</span>, which for 
			STP and RSTP 
			is zero, and for MSTP is populated by the library with the tree index (zero for the CIST, 
			1..64 for MSTIs)</li>
		<li><span class="auto-style3">48 bits with the MAC address</span>. These are the least 
			significant bits, and they are settable with <a href="STP_SetBridgeAddress.html">
			STP_SetBridgeAddress</a>.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
			Execution of this function is a potentially lengthy process. 
			It may call various callbacks multiple times.</p>
	<p>
			This function <strong>may not</strong> be called from within an <a href="STP_CALLBACKS.html">STP callback</a>.</p>
